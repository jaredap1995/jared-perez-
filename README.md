# Jared Perez's Personal Website

Welcome to the repository of my personal website. This platform serves as a reflection of my academic pursuits, professional endeavors, and a sneak peek into some of my future projects. 

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Next.js**: The React framework was chosen for its flexibility, ease of routing, and built-in server-side rendering capabilities, making the website lightning-fast and SEO-friendly.
- **React**: The library that powers the website, allowing for a modular and component-based architecture.
- **SCSS**: For styling the components, SCSS was chosen because of its advanced features that aren't available in vanilla CSS, making the styling process more maintainable and organized.
- **Vercel**: The website is hosted on Vercel, which offers a seamless deployment experience for Next.js projects.

## 📜 Research Papers

One of the website's highlights is the inclusion of my research papers. I integrated a dedicated section where visitors can delve into the summaries of my academic works, get insights into the topics I've explored, and even access the papers directly for a comprehensive read.

## 🚀 Future Goals

1. **Community Blog**: One of my aspirations for the website is to transform it into a hub of knowledge and insights. I'm working on integrating a feature that would allow community members to pen down their thoughts, experiences, and expertise, turning the website into a collective blog.
  
2. **Data Science Projects**: As a passionate data scientist, I'm planning to host some of my data science projects on the website. This would not only serve as a portfolio but also a learning resource for those interested in the field.
