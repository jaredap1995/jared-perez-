        title: "Defining Human Readiness for Task Performance with an Ambient and Wearable Sensor Based Human Digital Twin",
        authors: ['Jared Perez', 'Tanuj Wadhi'],
        summary: "With the advent of powerful machine learning algorithims and improved computational modeling techniques, the concept of 'Digital Twins' has increased in popularity. Digital Twins are exact digital replicas of a physical entitiy existing in the real world. Digitakl twins have typically been used in manufacturing though recently have been extended to human beings and biological systems. The aim of this research was to attempt to predict readiness to combined physical and mental tasks through a human digital twin and explore what fiedlity architecture produced the best results.",

        title: "Physiological Exercise Monitoring Defined",
        authors: ['Jared Perez', 'Eric Helms', 'Adam Storey'],
        summary: "A plethora of research in recent years focused on exercise monitoring and the use of wearables and other biosensors to optimize and enhance performance, recovery, and adaptation from exercise. Lost in this literature is a defintion of what actually consists exercise monitoring. In this paper I aim to outline a preliminary definition of exercise monitoring from the perspective of physiological adaptation.",

        title: "Redox Monitoring for Health and Performance",
        authors: ['Jared Perez', 'Nikos Margaritelis'],
        summary: "The maintenance of physiological homeostasis is a prerequisite for biological life. How biological organisms manage to adapt to repeated acute stressors and build resilience to subseqeunt stressors remains unclear. In this paper, I review what is currently known regarding redox biology in the context of one of the best understood physiological stressors: exercise. I review the existing literature that supports redox regulation maintains health and improves readinesn and performance, and redox dysregulation leads to disease, aging, and exercise intolerance.",

        title: "Redox Biology at the Intersection of Health and Performance in Women: The Role of Ovarian Hormones",
        authors: ['Jared Perez', 'Stacy Sims', 'Adam Storey', 'Bruce Hamilton'],
        summary: 'It is well established that the ovarian hormones play a signifcant role in the health and longevity of women. Despite the pronounced effects of menopause in the absence of ovarian hormones, the various studies on ovarian hormone replacement therapy, and extensive evidence supporting an impact at different concentrations throughout the menstural cycle. The exact mechnaisms to which these hormones impact their diverse physiological responses is unknown. Building off the established role of redox molecules and the pronounced redox actions of estrogen, I build the case that redox interactions underpin many of these effects and explore some potential molecular mechanisms.',

        title: "Endurance Training Negatively Impacts Force Responses in Rugby Union Players",
        authors: ['Jared Perez', 'Thomas Jones'],
        summary: "The interference effect is a well defined phenomene via which endurance training blunts the molecular and functional adaptations of resistance training. Though this phenomenon is established. The exact training variables that elicit and or mitigate this effect are unknown. My research aimed to understand how varying endurnace training volume impacted acute force repsonses.",
